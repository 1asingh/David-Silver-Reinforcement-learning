# Week 3 - Planning by Dynamic Programming

The code demonstrates the policy iteration and value iteration algorithms 
described in the 3rd Lecture - Planning by Dynamic Programming.

## Environment

![frozen-lake](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a0814496cf9b80e053f4c40eb1e66ca2845e6e98/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f78676f4f3534714e346c592f6d617872657364656661756c742e6a7067)

## Running the code

```bash
python frozen_lake.py
```
## Results
Since both the algorithms are computationally expensive, it might take a while for the results. 
You should get something similar to the image below.
