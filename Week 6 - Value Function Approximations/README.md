# Week 6: Value Function Approximations

This week covers the value function approximations which make RL scalable. 
The code demonstrates these algorithms in different environments.

## Summary

- The methods that have been described earlier are not practical for the kind of problems that RL are applied to because of the sheer 
number of states and corresponding actions possible. For large-scale problems, we use **Function Approximators**.
